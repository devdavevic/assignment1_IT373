# Reflection of Dave victor Malate

Setting up the environment for this Django project was both a challenge and a learning experience. At the beginning, one of the difficulties I encountered was making sure that Python and Django were properly installed and matched with the correct versions. I initially ran into an error when my virtual environment was not activated, which caused Django commands to fail. I solved this by carefully checking the activation command for my operating system and making sure `(venv)` appeared before the terminal path.  

Another challenge was resolving the `TemplateDoesNotExist` error when I tried to load my home page. I discovered that I had placed my templates folder in the wrong directory. After reviewing the Django documentation and checking the settings file, I corrected the template path and the page finally rendered.  

Finally, I learned how to connect my local project to GitHub. Pushing code to a remote repository required me to set the origin URL and use the proper commit workflow. These steps helped me understand version control more clearly. Overall, the setup process was challenging, but I gained valuable skills in troubleshooting and configuring a Django environment.
